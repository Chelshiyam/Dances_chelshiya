            Bharatnatyam is one of the oldest dance forms from the state of Tamil Nadu. It is one of the eight classical dance forms in India. Originated in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, it is also known as the Sadir or Daasiyatam.
            Bharatanatyam is a variety of 'Natya' yoga that reveals the spiritual self of the physical & emotional body. It is the most ancient & popular of classical Indian dance Styles, all of which are based on Natya Shastra. Bharatanatyam was born in temples as an offering to Gods.
            Sadiraattam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century.It was banned by the colonial British government in 1910, but the Indian community protested against the ban and expanded its performance outside temples in the 20th century as Bharatanatyam
