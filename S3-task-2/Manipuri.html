            Manipuri dance originated in the state of Manipur in the northeastern region of India
            Manipuri is an ancient classical dance form that originated in the northeastern state of Manipur in India. Its origins can be traced back to ancient times, even before recorded history began. Lai Haraoba is the earliest form of dance in Manipur, and it forms the basis of all such dances.
            This article is about a classical dance form of Meitei culture, officially recognised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi. For the other officially unrecognized classical dance forms, see Classicism in Meitei dances.
